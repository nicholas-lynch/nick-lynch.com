            one day this will be my personal website with a portfolio of interesting projects and an easily readable outline of my skills and experience but I get sucked into a ridiculous tangent and overcomplicate things every time I try working on it so for the time being here is a single page with a rotating cube and some text which I am paying 20 bucks a month to keep up
